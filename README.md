# automate-boring-stuff-scripts
This is a repository that contains all of my work while reading through Automate the Boring Stuff With Python, as well as following the UDEMY course by Al Sweigart. Some of these scripts have been worked on in the years 2020 and 2021 when I first picked up this book, and others have been worked on when I picked this up again in 2025. The Python programs found in the projects and mini_projects folders have been created by me, from scratch, and with the criteria outlined by the exercise in the book. The python programs found in the practice folders are programs either taken from the book that I worked through, or they are examples of practice problems that I worked on.
