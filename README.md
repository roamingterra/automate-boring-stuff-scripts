# automate-boring-stuff-scripts
This is a repository that contains all of the Python scripts that I've worked on while reading through Automate the Boring Stuff With Python by Al Sweigart. Some of these scripts have been worked on in the years 2020 and 2021 when I first picked up this book, and others have been worked on when I picked this up again in 2025.
